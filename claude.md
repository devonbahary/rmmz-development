keep responses short

for developing rmmz-plugins:

- you can find the source code for RMMZ organized in /packages/rmmz-plugins/rmmz-js. the file names in the directories that follow match the class names that you want to reference
- when working in files that overwrite/extend RMMZ classes, try to keep the logic short. if it gets overlong, the logic belongs in a utility file
